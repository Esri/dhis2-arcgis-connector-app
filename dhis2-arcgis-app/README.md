# DHIS2 to ArcGIS Connector App

This repository contains a DHIS2 webapp that creates a near-real time connection between DHIS2 data and ArcGIS Enterprise using custom data feeds. The connection allows for seamless data sharing, analysis, and visualization.

To use this app, you will need a DHIS2 instance and an ArcGIS named user account in ArcGIS Enterprise. Contact globalhealth@esri.com for more information about ArcGIS access.

This app can be accessed through the [DHIS2 App Hub](https://apps.dhis2.org/).

## Documentation and Use

See the documentation about implementing the app [DHIS2 to ArcGIS Connector Documentation](https://github.com/ArcGIS/dhis2-arcgis-connector-koop?tab=readme-ov-file).

### ArcGIS Enterprise

ArcGIS Enterprise delivers industry-leading mapping and analytics to your infrastructure and the cloud. Through ArcGIS Enterprsie you can make maps and apps, manage data, share and collaborate, and perform analysis.

This app allows DHIS2 users to leverage their data in the ArcGIS system using a direct connection that maintains data hosting in their DHIS2 instance. The app uses a no-code interface to allow for seamless interoperability. The connection is formed through [Custom Data Feeds](https://enterprise.arcgis.com/en/server/11.1/develop/linux/custom-data-feeds.htm). View the GitHub repository for the [DHIS2 Custom Data Feeds] (https://github.com/ArcGIS/dhis2-custom-data-feeds) for more information.

### DHIS2 (District Health Information Software 2)

DHIS2 is an open-source platform for managing and analyzing health data. It is designed to support the collection, analysis, and visualization of health information at various levels, from local clinics to national health systems. Here are some key points to understand about DHIS2:

- **Data Collection**: DHIS2 provides tools for data collection, allowing health workers to enter and submit data electronically. It supports various data types, including routine health facility data, surveys, and aggregate data.
- **Data Management**: DHIS2 offers a robust data management system, allowing users to define data elements, indicators, data sets, and data validation rules. It supports data aggregation, data quality checks, and data import/export functionalities.
- **Analytics and Reporting**: DHIS2 includes powerful analytics and reporting features. It enables users to generate a wide range of reports, charts, and visualizations to gain insights from the collected data. It supports standard health indicators, custom indicators, and data visualization tools.
- **Customization and Configuration**: DHIS2 is highly customizable and configurable to meet the specific needs of different health systems. Users can define their own data elements, indicators, and data entry forms. The system supports multiple languages, user roles, and access controls.
- **Interoperability**: DHIS2 supports interoperability with other health information systems and standards. It can integrate with external systems through APIs, data exchange formats (such as XML and JSON), and standard protocols (such as HL7 and OpenHIE).
- **Mobile and Offline Capabilities**: DHIS2 offers mobile and offline data collection capabilities, allowing health workers to collect and submit data using mobile devices even in areas with limited or no internet connectivity.
- **Community and Support**: DHIS2 has a vibrant and active community of users, developers, and implementers. The community provides support, shares best practices, and contributes to the ongoing development and improvement of DHIS2.

DHIS2 is widely used globally, particularly in low-resource settings, to strengthen health information systems and improve data-driven decision-making in healthcare. Its open-source nature, flexibility, and scalability make it a valuable tool for managing health data and improving health outcomes.
